<h3>Example Explained</h3>
<p><strong>The <code class="w3-codespan">.modal</code> class</strong></p>
<p>The <code class="w3-codespan">.modal</code> class represents the window BEHIND the actual modal box. The 
height and width is set to 100%, which should create the illusion of a 
background window. </p>
<button id="delete-button" type="button"> Delete agent </button> 
<p>Add a black background color with opacity. </p>
<p>Set position to fixed; meaning it will move up and down the page when the 
user scrolls.</p>
<p>It is hidden by default, and should be shown with a click of a button (we'll 
cover this later).</p>
<p><strong>The <code class="w3-codespan">.modal-content</code> class</strong></p>
<p>This is the actual modal box that gets focus. Do whatever you want with it. 
We have got you started with a border, some padding, and a background color. The
<code class="w3-codespan">margin: 15% auto</code> is used to push the modal box down from the top (15%) and 
centering it (auto).</p>
<p>We also set the width to 400px - this could be more or less, depending on 
screen size. We 
will cover this later.</p>
<p><strong>The <code class="w3-codespan">.close</code> class</strong></p>
<p>The close button is styled with a large font-size, a specific color and 
floats to the right. We have also added some styles that will change the color 
of the close button when the user moves the mouse over it.</p>
